# Continuous Discovery Framework

Evidence-based approach to product discovery based on Teresa Torres' methodology. Enables teams to make customer-informed decisions through structured, ongoing research.

## üéØ Framework Overview

**Continuous Discovery** shifts from project-based research to ongoing customer engagement, ensuring product decisions are grounded in current customer reality rather than assumptions or outdated insights.

### Core Principles
1. **Weekly customer touchpoints** to maintain connection with user reality
2. **Small research activities** that provide continuous learning  
3. **Assumption-driven inquiry** focused on reducing product risk
4. **Cross-functional participation** to build shared understanding
5. **Decision-focused research** tied to specific product choices

## üîÑ Discovery Cycle (Weekly Rhythm)

### Monday: Plan Discovery Activities
**Goal**: Identify highest-risk assumptions and plan validation approaches

**Activities** (30 minutes):
- Review upcoming product decisions
- Identify critical assumptions requiring validation  
- Plan customer touchpoints for the week
- Assign research responsibilities across team

**Deliverable**: Weekly research plan with specific objectives

### Tuesday-Thursday: Execute Discovery
**Goal**: Gather evidence through customer interaction

**Activities** (2-3 hours across 3 days):
- Conduct 2-3 customer interviews (15-30 minutes each)
- Run unmoderated usability tests or surveys
- Analyze user behavior data and feedback
- Document insights immediately after each activity

**Deliverable**: Raw customer insights and evidence

### Friday: Synthesize and Decide  
**Goal**: Transform insights into product decisions

**Activities** (45 minutes):
- Team synthesis session to identify patterns
- Map insights to current assumptions and decisions
- Update product direction based on evidence
- Plan follow-up research needs

**Deliverable**: Updated product roadmap and new assumptions to test

## üéØ Customer Interview Framework

### Interview Types by Discovery Goal

#### **Generative Interviews** (Explore problem space)
- **Purpose**: Understand customer jobs, pain points, and context
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes  
- **Frequency**: 1-2 per week
- **Structure**: Job mapping, pain point exploration, context understanding

#### **Evaluative Interviews** (Test specific solutions)
- **Purpose**: Validate concepts, prototypes, or existing features  
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes
- **Frequency**: 2-3 per week  
- **Structure**: Concept presentation, feedback collection, preference testing

#### **Behavioral Interviews** (Understand usage patterns)
- **Purpose**: Learn how customers actually use products in context
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes
- **Frequency**: 1-2 per week
- **Structure**: Screen sharing, workflow observation, context inquiry

### Interview Protocol Template

#### Pre-Interview (5 minutes)
- **Rapport building**: "Thanks for joining. How has your [day/week/project] been going?"
- **Context setting**: "I'm working on understanding how [customer type] approaches [problem area]"
- **Permission**: "I'd love to learn from your experience. Can I record this for note-taking?"

#### Main Interview (15-35 minutes)
**For Generative Research:**
1. **Recent experience**: "Can you walk me through the last time you [needed to accomplish job]?"
2. **Context exploration**: "What led up to that need?"  
3. **Process mapping**: "Take me through your approach step by step"
4. **Pain point identification**: "What was frustrating or difficult about that?"
5. **Success criteria**: "How did you know when you were successful?"

**For Evaluative Research:**
1. **Context reminder**: "Thinking about when you [specific job context]..."
2. **Concept introduction**: "I'd like to show you an idea we're exploring"
3. **Initial reaction**: "What's your first impression?"
4. **Detailed feedback**: "How would this fit into your current process?"
5. **Preference testing**: "How does this compare to your current approach?"

#### Wrap-up (5 minutes)
- **Additional insights**: "What haven't we covered that would be helpful for me to know?"
- **Follow-up permission**: "Would you be open to a brief follow-up as we develop this further?"
- **Thank you**: Appreciate their time and expertise

## üìä Research Planning Framework

### Assumption Mapping Process

#### Step 1: Identify Product Decisions (15 minutes)
List upcoming product choices requiring customer insight:
- Feature prioritization decisions
- Design direction choices  
- Market positioning questions
- User experience assumptions

#### Step 2: Extract Assumptions (15 minutes)  
For each decision, identify underlying beliefs:
- Customer behavior assumptions
- Value proposition assumptions
- Usability assumptions
- Market need assumptions

#### Step 3: Risk Assessment (10 minutes)
Rate each assumption on:
- **Impact**: How much does this assumption affect success? (1-5)
- **Confidence**: How certain are we this assumption is true? (1-5)  
- **Risk Score**: Impact √ó (6 - Confidence) = Priority for testing

#### Step 4: Research Design (10 minutes)
For highest-risk assumptions, design research approach:
- **Research question**: What specifically do we need to learn?
- **Method**: Interview, survey, usability test, data analysis?
- **Participants**: Who can best inform this assumption?
- **Success criteria**: What evidence would validate/invalidate the assumption?

### Weekly Research Calendar Template

| Day | Activity | Duration | Participants | Focus |
|-----|----------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Monday | Research Planning | 30 min | Full team | Assumption identification |
| Tuesday | Customer Interview #1 | 30 min | 1 customer | [Specific research question] |
| Wednesday | Customer Interview #2 | 30 min | 1 customer | [Specific research question] |
| Thursday | Usability Testing | 45 min | 2-3 customers | [Specific concept/feature] |
| Friday | Synthesis Session | 45 min | Full team | Insight consolidation |

## üß† Insight Synthesis Methods

### Individual Synthesis (After each research activity)
**Immediate capture** (5 minutes post-interview):
1. **Key quotes**: 2-3 direct customer statements
2. **Behavioral observations**: What did they actually do vs. say?
3. **Assumption updates**: Which assumptions were supported/challenged?
4. **Follow-up questions**: What new questions emerged?

### Team Synthesis (Weekly session)
**Pattern identification** (45 minutes):

#### Round 1: Share Insights (15 minutes)
- Each team member shares 2-3 key insights from the week
- Focus on surprising findings or assumption challenges
- No discussion yet - just information sharing

#### Round 2: Pattern Recognition (15 minutes)  
- Look for themes across multiple customer interactions
- Identify conflicting evidence requiring further research
- Note insights that consistently appear across different contexts

#### Round 3: Decision Impact (15 minutes)
- Map patterns to current product decisions
- Identify decisions where we now have sufficient evidence  
- Flag decisions requiring additional research before proceeding

## ‚úÖ Research Quality Standards

### Good Customer Insight
- [ ] **Specific and behavioral**: Describes what customers do, not what they say they do
- [ ] **Contextually rich**: Includes situational factors that influence behavior
- [ ] **Decision-relevant**: Directly informs a product choice we need to make
- [ ] **Evidence-based**: Supported by multiple data points or customer interactions

### Effective Research Process  
- [ ] **Assumption-driven**: Each research activity tests specific beliefs
- [ ] **Collaborative**: Cross-functional team participates in research activities
- [ ] **Continuous**: Regular rhythm of customer contact, not project-based
- [ ] **Action-oriented**: Research consistently influences product decisions

## üö® Common Discovery Mistakes

### ‚ùå Research Anti-Patterns
- **Solution validation bias**: Only seeking evidence that supports existing ideas
- **Demographic screening**: Focusing on who customers are vs. what they're trying to do
- **Feature request collection**: Asking customers to design solutions
- **Sporadic research**: Conducting research only when facing major decisions

### ‚úÖ Discovery Best Practices  
- **Job-focused inquiry**: Understand the functional job customers are hiring your product to do
- **Behavioral evidence**: Observe what customers do, not just what they say
- **Assumption testing**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence for your beliefs
- **Systematic rhythm**: Maintain regular customer contact regardless of development phase
