### Prioritization Framework

#### Impact/Effort Matrix in Linear
Use custom fields to track:
- **Customer Impact**: 1-5 scale based on research evidence
- **Business Impact**: 1-5 scale tied to company objectives  
- **Implementation Effort**: Story points or t-shirt sizing
- **Research Confidence**: How certain are we about customer need?

#### Priority Scoring Formula
`Priority Score = (Customer Impact + Business Impact) / Implementation Effort √ó Research Confidence`
