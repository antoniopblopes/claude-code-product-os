# Project Management

*Central coordination and progress tracking for product initiatives*

## Purpose

This directory provides project management tools and documentation for coordinating product work across teams, tracking progress toward business objectives, and maintaining organizational clarity on priorities and outcomes.

## Structure

### Meeting Notes (`meeting-notes/`)
**Standardized meeting documentation** for consistent information capture and action tracking:
- **Research sessions**: Customer interview insights and discovery findings
- **Strategic planning**: Product direction decisions and roadmap updates  
- **Cross-functional sync**: Engineering, design, and product alignment meetings
- **Stakeholder updates**: Executive briefings and organizational communication

### Progress Tracking (`progress-tracking/`)
**Systematic measurement** of initiative progress and business impact:
- **Milestone tracking**: Key deliverable completion and timeline management
- **Metrics dashboards**: Business outcome measurement and trend analysis
- **Risk monitoring**: Issue identification and mitigation tracking
- **Success assessment**: Post-launch analysis and learning capture

## Key Frameworks

### Meeting Documentation Standard
Every meeting note should include:
- **Participants**: Who was involved and their roles
- **Objective**: Why the meeting occurred and desired outcomes
- **Key Decisions**: What was decided and who has accountability
